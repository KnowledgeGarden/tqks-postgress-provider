GOALS
	DEPRECATED PostgreSql driver for SQL and Cypher Graph Language
		based on AgensGraph
	GENERAL PURPOSE PostgreSQL driver
	TO be used by DSLs
		E.G
			Blueprints
			TopicMap
			Prolog

USER MANUAL
	psql postgres  get into commandline app
	\l to list tables
	\q to quit pgsql
	CREATE ROLE
	CREATE ROLE username WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'quoted password'
		Those from postgress-props.xml
		e.g.
		CREATE ROLE testuser WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'testpwd';
	
	DATABASE CREATION
	For each graph to be maintained, user must create a database with that 
		graphName, and the userName and password specified in /config/postgress-props.xml
		Example
			CREATE DATABASE <dbname> --encoding utf-8 --username username --password pwd
			e.g. (password doesn't work)
			//these are used in devtests
			CREATE DATABASE testdb ENCODING 'UTF-8' OWNER 'testuser';
			CREATE DATABASE mynewdb ENCODING 'UTF-8' OWNER 'testuser';

NOTES
	20170921
		AgensGraph is "community edition"
			Do not know if it knows how to deal with
				PostgreSql clusters
MASTER TODO
	MODIFY TO GAIN ACCESS TO ONE INSTANCE, MULTIPLE DRIVERS
		That is, common socket, multiple graphs
		CONSIDER
			SMALL hidden class that generates connection against
				a databaseName
			getInstance() of platform
			then IConnection getDriver(String databaseName)
				where IConnection defined as Connection getConnection()

			VALIDATES database!
		ADDED SecondTest
			Does simple insert and select!
		ADDED ThirdTest
